This app helps you stay focused on whatever task you are working on. How? Simple: 

1. You turn on the "focused mode", then you focus on your task and ignore distractions.
2. After a set duration (e.g. 30 minutes), you turn off the focused mode, take a break and manage the distractions you ignored.
